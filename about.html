            We are a caring tech-savy group of professionals that want to change the way the world thinks about agriculture.
            Our goal is to empower cities with the ability to feed all of their citizens. We hope to erradicate hunger from 
            city streets while also vastly improving the quality of food everyone consumes.

        We are also a well oiled machine. Each and everyone member of our team works seemlessly with one another to achieve
        our common goals. As such we all share life together - meals, vehicles, clothing, tools, and whatever else we can find to help
        our fellow vert farmer in life. You might think we're a bit off our rocker, but we are all enjoying life to the fullest together!
